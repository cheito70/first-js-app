# Pokefind App

##Project Description


This Pokefind App is a small web application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that loads
data from an external API and enables the viewing of data points in detail.
When a button with the pokemon's name is clicked, a modal is triggered to show the pokemon's name, picture, height, weight, and type. A user can also use the search box if they cannot find the pokemon on the list. The modal can be closed with either the escape  key, or clicking the x on the modal.
The project uses the Poke api found at pokeapi.co.
